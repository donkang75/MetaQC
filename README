__Genomic meta-analyses__ for combining microarray studies have been widely applied to increase statistical power and to validate results from individual studies. Currently, the inclusion/exclusion criteria mostly depend on ad-hoc expert opinion or na√Øve decision by sample size or array platform. No objective quality assessment is available. 

__MetaQC__ implements our proposed quantitative quality control measures: 

* (1) internal homogeneity of co-expression structure among studies (internal quality control; __IQC__)
* (2) external consistency of co-expression structure correlating with pathway database (external quality control; __EQC__)
* (3) accuracy of differentially expressed gene detection (accuracy quality control; __AQCg__) or pathway identification (__AQCp__)
* (4) consistency of differential expression ranking in genes (consistency quality control; __CQCg__) or pathways (__CQCp__). 

For each quality control index, the p-values from statistical hypothesis testing are minus log transformed and PCA biplots were applied to assist visualization and decision. Results generate systematic suggestions to exclude problematic studies in microarray meta-analysis and potentially can be extended to GWAS or other types of genomic meta-analysis. The identified problematic studies can be scrutinized to identify technical and biological causes (e.g. sample size, platform, tissue collection, preprocessing etc) of their bad quality or irreproducibility for final inclustion/exclusion decision.
